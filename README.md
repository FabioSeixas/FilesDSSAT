## FilesDSSAT

This was an exercise I made to extract data from an Excel file and organize it into a `.CST` file (DSSAT specific format). It can also extract data from a `.CST` file to a pandas dataframe.

## Overview

The Excel file contains field data from cassava experiments.

The `.CST` is where we inform real data for DSSAT. With a `.CST` we are able to compare this results against simulations.
That is used for model **calibration** and **validation** purposes.
